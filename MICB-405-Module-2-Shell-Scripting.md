Exercise 1 - Write a shell script that prints “Shell Scripting is Fun!” on the screen

Exercise 2 - Write a shell script to check to see if the file “file_path” exists. If it does exist, display “file_path passwords are enabled.” Next, check to see if you can write to the file. If you can, display “You have permissions to edit “file_path.””If you cannot, display “You do NOT have permissions to edit “file_path””

Exercise 3 - Write a shell script that displays “man”,”bear”,”pig”,”dog”,”cat”,and “sheep” on the screen with each appearing on a separate line. Try to do this in as few lines as possible.

Exercise 4 - write a shell script that prompts the user for a name of a file or directory and reports if it is a regular file, a directory, or another type of file. Also perform an ls command against the file or directory with the long listing option.

Exercise 5 - Modify the previous script to that it accepts the file or directory name as an argument instead of prompting the user to enter it.

Exercise 7 - Write a script that executes the command “cat/etc/shadow”. If the command return a 0 exit status, report “command succeeded” and exit with a 0 exit status. If the command returns a non-zero exit status, report “Command failed” and exit with a 1 exit status.
