Welcome to the first MICB-405 lab! Today, we're going to get started with the essential skills and tools you'll be using for the rest of the course.

## Accessing Bash on Linux or an equivalent
In order to use the server your computer will either need a terminal/command-line interface or an emulator. These will be necessary for using the software tools throughout this course, so donâ€™t think you can get away with not familiarizing yourself with one of these! 

If you are running a Unix-derived operating system like macOS or a Linux distribution like Ubuntu, simply run the "Terminal" app.

For the folks with Windows - there are several options.

If you are running Windows 10, I would highly recommend the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

You also have the option to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which will allow you to have a terminal that is similar to the *nix operating systems on your computer.
