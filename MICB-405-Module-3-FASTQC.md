### Main Excercise - Part 1
Navigate to ```/projects/micb405/data/Ebola```. You should see paired-end FASTQ files. Let's say these files just came off the sequencer, and you want to take a quick look ensure nothing went awry during the sequencing process. You're not interested in the exact stats, but you still want to take a look at all the modules in the graphical HTML report.
Perform FASTQC on them, outputting the results to somewhere on your home directory.
```scp``` just the .html files to your computer. (Hint: remember )
